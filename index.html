                <h2>the cat, the myth, the legend</h2>
                <p>mochi is a stray cat discord bot who specializes in casino games but also offers wholesome services
                    like daily fortune cookies, user stat horoscopes, and treat allowances. those degenerate enough to
                    gamble with mochi can climb their way up his global ranks by collecting treats from their winnings
                    and spending them sparingly in his shop.</p>
                <p>you can command mochi to do your dirty (or clean) bidding. or if you're normal, you can pet him, play
                    with him, and dote on him like you would an actual cat. you can attempt to get mochi's attention by
                    saying his name or meowing. you can also get mochi to rate anything in the world by feeding it to
                    him.</p>
